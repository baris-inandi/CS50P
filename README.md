# CS50P
My problem sets and final project for the Harvard University course CS50P: CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python.

This repo is meant as an archive only and not intended to be submitted as your own solutions. Please respect the CS50P [Academic Honesty Policy](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/honesty/).

> This course’s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as “be reasonable.” The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. The course’s policy characterizes both sides of that line.
